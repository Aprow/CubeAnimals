Hi, I am TB the developer of the game.
To play this game, you need python3, and installed all files listed in the requirements.txt, you can use the command pip install -r requirements to do that. 
Also, this game is only available for windows user.
After all dependencies prepared, run main.py in the IDE (or command line) to start the game.
Have a good time!
