Hi, I am T.B, a new-hand developer.
The game needs pgzero.
Please install python,and use cmd to install it.
(just print"pip install pgzero" in cmd)
After that you can open main.py in any python IDE(like Thonny), then enjoy it.
This game are still in process.
Feel free to share my code, and if you have any advise about the game or want to work with me please contact me in github.
Thanks!
